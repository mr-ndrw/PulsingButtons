# PulsingButtons
Small application for iPhone which basically allows user to configure the number of rows and columns of buttons and then click on said created buttons and watch the pulse, change color and generally be mildly interesting to the user for about a minute or less.

Serves as a playground for my humble self to goof around with Swift and iOS platform.
